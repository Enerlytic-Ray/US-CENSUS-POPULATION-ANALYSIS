# 🏛️ U.S. Census Population Analysis (2010–2015)

> 📊 A comprehensive exploratory data analysis of U.S. Census population data (2010–2015) using Python and the PPDAC framework — uncovering demographic trends, regional structures, and state-level population insights.

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This project analyzes population distribution and growth patterns across the United States from 2010 to 2015 using the official **U.S. Census Bureau dataset**.  
By applying the **PPDAC methodology** — *Problem, Plan, Data, Analysis, and Conclusion* — the study demonstrates a systematic approach to demographic data analysis.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Identify which U.S. state has the most counties.  
- Determine the three most populous states (based on their top three counties).  
- Find which county name appears most frequently across the U.S.  
- Identify the region with the highest number of divisions.  
- Visualize population trends and regional differences from 2010–2015.

## 🔍 Analytical Framework (PPDAC)
1. **Problem:** Identify and understand patterns of population growth and distribution across the U.S.  
2. **Plan:** Use structured EDA and visualization methods to explore the dataset.  
3. **Data:** Load and preprocess the U.S. Census 2015 dataset, filtering for county-level data (`SUMLEV=050`).  
4. **Analysis:** Perform groupings, aggregations, and visualizations to answer key demographic questions.  
5. **Conclusion:** Summarize results and extract actionable insights.
